"""Project data directory layout under admin storage.

Layout::

    {storage_root}/admin/project_data/
    └── {project_id}/
        └── (arbitrary files for that project)

Use project_data_prefix(project_id) to get the storage path prefix for a project.
Per-project directories are created on first write; the project_data root is
created when the storage backend is initialized.

Relationship to plans: A plan can be used as a project scope by using plan_id
as project_id (e.g. project_data/{plan_id}/ for plan-specific files). Plan
artifact metadata lives in SQLite (plan_artifacts table); project_data is for
binary artifact files and custom layout per project.
