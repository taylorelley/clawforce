## Releasing (Maintainers)

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. **Version is not stored in the repo** — it comes from git tags (or the workflow input in CI). Member packages use `hatch-vcs` to derive version from git; locally you get `0.0.0.dev0` when there is no tag.

To create a new release you only need to provide the version in the workflow (or push a tag).

**Option A — Version input only (recommended):**

1. In GitHub: **Actions → Release → Run workflow**. Enter the version (e.g. `0.1.2`) in the **version** input and run.
2. The workflow runs from the current commit, uses that version for builds and the GitHub release, and creates tag `vX.Y.Z`. No file edits.

**Option B — Manual tag:**

1. Create and push the tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
2. The push of the tag triggers the Release workflow (version is taken from the tag).

In both options, the Release workflow runs tests, builds and pushes the Docker image, publishes the bridge npm package (if applicable), and creates the GitHub release.

### Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### PyPI Publishing

Python packages (`specops_lib`, `specialagent`, `specops`) are built as part of CI (`ci.yml`) and uploaded as artifacts, but are not automatically published to PyPI in the current release workflow. To publish to PyPI, use [PyPI Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) (OIDC, no API tokens needed). If you add a PyPI publish step to `release.yml`, configure a trusted publisher in PyPI for each package:
- Repository: `taylorelley/specops`
- Workflow: `release.yml`
- Environment: `release`
